An open-data fantasy football repository, maintained by the DynastyProcess team. 

The main files available are:

- db_playerids.csv
- db_fpecr.csv (and db_fpecr.parquet) - use parquet for python/R, it's faster/better!
- values.csv (and sibling files values-players.csv and values-picks.csv)

and a few more to come!
