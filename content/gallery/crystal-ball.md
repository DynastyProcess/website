The Crystal Ball predicts how your team will finish the season - should you be rebuilding or pushing all-in?

### What is "All Play Percentage"?

All Play Percentage is the percentage of games you would win if you played every team in the league every week. It's a good proxy for how good your team is relative to the other teams in the league. We calculate the win probability of any given game as a proportion of your team's all play percentage compared to your opponent's.
