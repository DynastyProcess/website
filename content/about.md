DynastyProcess.com is a collaboration by Tan Ho and Joe Sydlowski. 

Our mission is to deliver high-quality resources and data for DynastyFF analysis and development.

We're dedicated to collaborative and open-source work. If you've got ideas, feedback, bugs, or any other extensions on the work found here, please reach out [directly on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dynastyprocess) and we'd love to have a conversation about it!

If you'd like to support us and the costs of running this project, we've got accounts set up at [Patreon](http://patreon.com/tanho) (for recurring contributions) and [PayPal](http://paypal.me/tan63) (for one-time contributions). We're happy to take support on a pay-what-you-can basis.
